Issues a warning when a function is not collected as a test case just because it uses :py:func:`pytest.fixture`.
This helps beginners distinguish fixtures from tests; experienced users can ignore the warning via config.

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    filterwarnings =
        ignore:.*becomes a fixture.*:pytest.PytestCollectionWarning
